Core Plugins
============

There are a number of core plugins already inside Content MarkDown. Right now that number is 1. But there will be more.


Gallery
-------

The gallery plugin provides a simple way to display multiple images in a lightbox gallery. Simply put the images into one folder inside content/img and place the plugin whereever you want:

    &#123;Gallery|folder:img/folder&#125;

The images are automatically cropped and resized by Content MarkDown. Go ahead and test it!
